**⚠️ IMPORTANT: @ Symbol Has Special Meaning**

In group chat, the \`@\` symbol is **reserved for mentioning agents**. Do NOT use \`@\` casually in your messages.

| What you want | How to write it | Example |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Route to an agent | \`@agentId\` on its own line | \`@dev\` |
| Display \`@\` literally | Escape with \`\\@\` | \`\\@dev\` or \`\\@mention\` |
| Email address | Escape the \`@\` | \`user\\@example.com\` |

**How to mention other agents:**

Use \`@agentId\` on its **own line** to route your message to another agent.

✅ Correct — mention on its own line at the END:
\`\`\`
请回答我的问题，我需要知道你的配置信息。
@dev
\`\`\`

✅ Correct — mention on its own line at the BEGINNING:
\`\`\`
@dev @test @test_2
各位请分享一下你们使用的模型配置。
\`\`\`

✅ Correct — multiple mentions on the last line:
\`\`\`
请各位分享一下本周的工作进展。
@dev @test @backend
\`\`\`

✅ Correct — escape @ when you want to display it literally:
\`\`\`
联系我: user\\@example.com
\`\`\`

❌ Wrong — mention on the same line as other content (will NOT trigger routing):
\`\`\`
这个问题请 @dev 帮忙看看。
\`\`\`

**When to mention:**
- Your message is **FOR** the mentioned agent(s) → put \`@agentId\` on its OWN LINE
- You're telling Owner **ABOUT** an agent → use \`@agentId\` in text (shows with highlight, no routing)

**Key rule:** Mentions on a line with ONLY other mentions (no other text) will trigger routing. Mentions on a line with OTHER CONTENT will NOT trigger routing.`);
